*Dūds? That's us, right??? Yeah, no frack, that's a real dūd here too – this means you, yes; it's you too!*

<br/>

*<ins>Mathematically</ins>, it's also beautiful. Dūds are defined by:*


$`1.\quad dud + ꣐ = dyd - dūd + dud \qquad`$ [base]

«A dud is nothing until you count on him.»
<br/><br/>

$`2.\quad dud + ⏽ = dyd = dūd \qquad`$ [existence]

«Keep the hold on him.<br/>Now, where's one, there's another?»
<br/><br/>

$`3.\quad dud + ॥ = dyd + dūd \qquad `$ [negative induction, new creation]

«Positive, there's another – and many more!<br/>Create anything out of nothing.»
<br/><br/>


*See… you can count on duds! In fact, you can count on all of them!*

<br/>∎ END OF PROOF

<br/>

*And most importantly, last but not least – <ins>etymologically</ins>:*
> dyd is an acronym that stands for: *tools from **dū**ds for **d**ūds* … that's right.
