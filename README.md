> – Something that doesn't work the way it's supposed to is a <ins>dūd</ins>.
>
> – Also, a <ins>dūd</ins> is a person with a record of failing; someone who loses consistently.[^1]

*Dūds? That's us, right??? Yeah, no frack, that's a real dūd here too – this means you, yes; it's you too!*

<br/>

*<ins>Mathematically</ins>, it's also beautiful. Dūds are defined by:*

1. $`dud + ꣐ = dyd - dūd + dud \qquad`$ [base]

«A dud is nothing until you count on him.»
<br/>
2. $`dud + ⏽ = dyd = dūd \qquad`$ [existence]

«Where's one, there's another?»
<br/>
3. $`dud + ॥ = dyd + dūd \qquad `$ [negative induction, new creation]

«Positive! create anything out of nothing.»

*See… you can count on duds! In fact, you can count on all of them! QED*

<br/>

*And most importantly, last but not least – <ins>etymologically</ins>:*
> dyd is an acronym that stands for: *tools from **dū**ds for **d**ūds* … that's right.
